WHY?

We created the M5 Coffee Shop website to make it easier for customers to connect with M5 Coffee Shop, anywhere. 
With the website, people can view the menu, learn about the coffee, place orders online. 
It will helps M5 Cofffee to reach more customers, improve convenience, and build a stronger relationship with customer.
